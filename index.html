        Hello, I'm Athanasios Kyriakakis, my friends and colleagues call me Thanos (no worries I don’t own any gloves).
        I was born in the Netherlands, both my parents are greek hence the unpronounceable name.
        I currently live in Utrecht and work in Amsterdam as a frontend developer. I always had a love
        for computers but it wasn’t until I turned 25 that I developed a passion for programming as well.
        I quit my then job in order to become a full-time developer, I can safely say now that it was one of
        the best decisions I ever made. First thing I did was sign up for an 8-week coding boot camp.
        I must say, it was really intense but it filled in all the blanks I had from practising on my own.
        After finishing the boot camp I started looking for a full-time job and I luckily landed in afrogleaps
        pond where I have been working ever since.
